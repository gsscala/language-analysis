I was sorely disappointed with this coffee maker. Not only does it take forever to brew a single cup, but the coffee it produces tastes weak and watered down. The design is uninspired, and the build quality feels cheap and plasticky. The programmable features are more hassle than they're worth, often malfunctioning or resetting randomly. Cleanup is a nightmare, with nooks and crannies that are impossible to reach. Save your money and invest in a higher-quality coffee maker.
