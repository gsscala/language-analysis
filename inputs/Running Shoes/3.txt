I had high hopes for these running shoes, but they failed to live up to expectations. The fit is awkward and uncomfortable, causing blisters and soreness even on short runs. The cushioning is insufficient, leaving my feet feeling battered and bruised after each workout. The design is uninspired, and the build quality feels cheap and flimsy. After just a few weeks of use, the soles started to peel away from the shoe. Overall, I would not recommend these running shoes to anyone serious about fitness.
