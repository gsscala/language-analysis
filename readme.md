# Introduction

In this project, I decided to combine two powerful AI tools: Azure and GPT. The latter would generate fictional opinions of unknown goods, which would then be analyzed by the former's tool Language Studio. The prompt given was this: "Create various product reviews of distinct areas, with different tones and sentiments". It generated 3 products, namely a coffee maker, some running shoes, and a smartphone, about which three opinions were created, with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. In total, 9 reviews were generated. Afterwards, they served as input to Azure's Language Studio, whose job was to just get the sentiment and opinions of the reviews.

### Systematization

Each text file is found in the input folder of this repository, with its corresponding output, generated by Azure, located in the homonymous folder.

# Takeaways

As expected, the tools worked harmoniously. GPT got the prompt right and generated good and genuine-sounding reviews, whose sentiments were correctly analyzed with nice accuracy by Azure's Language Studio. It was surprising to see how it correctly extracted the assessments' sentiments, even more complex ones, such as "gets the job done" in the second coffee maker review.
